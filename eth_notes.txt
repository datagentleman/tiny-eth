--[ Transaction

  - We have 3 transaction types: legacy, access_list, dynamic_fee

    From what I see the only differences between them are 
      -- ChainID    *big.Int
      -- GasFeeCap  *big.Int
      -- GasTipCap  *big.Int
      -- AccessList AccessList


--[ DB

  - Get block by number

    -- First, based on block number we must get block hash_key (GetHashKey())
    	 hash_key = headerPrefix + encodeBlockNumber(number) + headerHashSuffix 
  
    -- Based on hash_key and block number we can generate block key (blockBodyKey())
	     block_key = blockBodyPrefix + encodeBlockNumber(number) + hash_key 


  - Why one block needs so many hashes(keys) in database ?


--[ P2P

    - Broadcast transaction
      - eth/handler.go:BroadcastTransactions()

    - Broadcast block
      - eth/handler.go:BroadcastBlock()
