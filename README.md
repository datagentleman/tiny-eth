# tiny-eth

This is ethereum implementation from scratch - I want to learn how it's working under the hood.

:money_with_wings: In other words I want to hack it and take all your crypto :money_with_wings:

This implementation will be based on the official geth code.
In the end it will be able to communicate with ethereum blockchain - all operations will be supported.
